# SINS4fun
Simulating INdividuals in Space (but in a much simpler way and perhaps funny way)


SINS for Simulating INdividuals in Space is a population genetics program that has been in development for a while at the Population and conservation genetics group at the Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia.

Here I show a <b>VERY<sup>VERY<sup>VERY</sup></sup></b> simplified version of SINS just so that people can better understand the concept and maybe have a little fun with the simulations.

Go to https://tiagomaie.github.io/SINS4fun/ and experiment for yourself.
